# Welcome to the XLibre packaging center!

Here we assemble information related to the packaging of XLibre for distributions and the use of the packages by users.

## For Users

At [Are We XLibre Yet? · X11Libre/xserver Wiki](https://github.com/X11Libre/xserver/wiki/Are-We-XLibre-Yet%3F), you will find an overview of which distributions have packages for XLibre. These include packages maintained directly by the distribution and those from third-party providers. You can also find links to discussions with other users to help each other. Similarly, you often can follow the links to report possible issues and suggest improvements.

At [X11Libre/packaging · Discussions · GitHub](https://github.com/X11Libre/packaging/discussions), you can view all discussions hosted by us and participate in them using your GitHub user account to find answers together.


## For Packagers

We welcome you at the [Maintainers Kitchen · Discussions · GitHub](https://github.com/X11Libre/packaging/discussions/categories/maintainers-kitchen). That's the place where maintainers can discuss everything related to packaging XLibre. A wiki is also being set up at [Home · X11Libre/packaging Wiki](https://github.com/X11Libre/packaging/wiki) with additional materials on these topics.
